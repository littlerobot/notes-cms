# Information Representation

## Number Representation

* **Denary:** normal integer numbers aaa
* **Binary**
  * Values stored as a series of ones and zeroes
  * A single 0 or 1 is called a binary digit or bit.
  * Any group of 0s & 1s can represent a character

| 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

* E.g. 65 in binary is 1000001
* **BCD** (Binary Coded Decimal):
  * Each digit in the number is written separately in a series of 4 bits
  * E.g. 398 in BCD
  * 3 = 0011 9 = 1001 8 = 1000
  * 398 = 001110011000
  * **Use of BCD:** used in business applications (arithmetic) where every
    digit has to be retained in a result
* **Hexadecimal Numbers:**
  * The base-16 number system (counting in 16)
  * After 9, numbers represented by letters from A to F

| 256 | 16  | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |

* E.g. A5 in Denary = $$\left( 16 \times 10 \right) + \left( 1 \times 5
  \right) = 165$$
* E.g. 65 in Hexadecimal = $$65 \div 16 = 4\ Remainder\ 1\therefore\  = 41$$ H
* Quick way of translating hexadecimal to binary is by converting the
  hexadecimal to BCD
* E.g. A5 in Binary: A = 1010 5 = 0101 A5 = 10100101
* **Two’s Complement:**
  * We can represent a negative number in binary by making the most
    significant bit (MSB) a sign bit, which will tell us whether the number
    is positive or negative.

| \-128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MSB   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | LSB |

* Converting a negative denary number into binary Two’s Complement:
  * Find the binary equivalent of the denary number
  * Add an extra bit before the MSB and turn that into 0
  * Flip all the bits: 0 to 1; 1 to 0
  * Add 1
* Converting Two’s Complement to denary:
  * Flip all the bits: 0 to 1; 1 to 0
  * Add 1
  * Simple conversion from binary to denary (put a –ve)

## Image Representation

* A **bitmapped image** is encoded by assigning a solid color to each pixel.
* **Pixels** are small blocks of addressable areas and the color they have is
  represented by binary & stored as bits
* A bitmapped image also contains a **file header** which are a few bytes of
  binary and represents basic information about the graphic, such as image
  resolution, size and number of colors.
* **Image Resolution:** the amount of pixels an image contains per inch or per
  centimeter.
* **Screen resolution:** the number of pixels per row by the number of pixels
  per column, e.g. HD is 720 by 1280 px

$$
Total\ Number\ of\ Pixels = Width \times Height
$$

* **Color depth:** number of bits used to represent the color of a single
  pixel
  * E.g. a 1 bit image can only store 21 pixels which equals to 2.
    Therefore, a 1 bit image is monochromatic
  * An image with _n_ bits has 2_n_ colors per pixel
  * The higher the color depth, the better color quality
  * The higher the color depth, the larger the file size.

$$
File\ Size = Number\ of\ Pixels \times Colour\ Depth
$$

* **Vector graphics**: images defined using mathematics & geometry i.e.
  points, lines, curves & shapes/polygon(s)
* Objects and properties are stored mathematically.
* **Drawing list:** set of commands used to define a vector
* Vectors are scalable and do not pixelate like a bitmap image therefore are
  used by corporations to create logos as they can be resized without losing
  quality
* Bitmapped images are used by general computer users as they are not big in
  file size and can be manipulated.

## Sound

* Sound are vibrations that travel through a medium
* Sound waves are continuous in nature, which means there is infinite amount
  of detail for a sound.
* **Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC):** converts analogue sound into
  digital signals which can be digitally stored
* **Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC)**: converts digital signals into
  analogue sound that can be output
* An analogue sound wave is picked up by a microphone and sent to an ADC in
  the form of analogue electrical signals. Once the sound wave is converted
  into a digital form it can be stored and manipulated
* Sound in analogue form can be represented by wave forms; the height of these
  waves can be **sampled** regularly with the height being represented by a
  bit-code

* **Sampling Rate:** number of samples taken per second
* A higher sampling rate means the waveform will be converted from analog to
  digital form more accurately.
* **Sampling Resolution:** no. of bits assigned to each sample
* The sampling resolution allows you to set the range of volumes storable for
  each sample
* The quality of a sound produced using a sound sampler depends on the
  sampling rate and sampling resolution
* Higher sampling rate/resolution means larger file size
* **Bit Rate:** number of bits required to store 1sec of sound

$$
Bit\ Rate = Sampling\ Rate \times Sampling\ Resolution
$$

$$
File\ Size = Bit\ Rate \times Length\ of\ Sound
$$

* **Lossless Compression:** type of compression that allows original data to
  be perfectly reconstructed from compression
  * **Run-length encoding:** compression in which sequences with same data
    value in many consecutive values are stored as a single data value and
    count
  * E.g. 00001234111111 can be written as (0-4)1234(1-6)
* **Lossy Compression:** type of compression in which file accuracy is low,
  but file size is smaller than lossless
  * **Perceptual coding:** works by reducing certain parts of a sound which
    are less audible to human hearing

## Video

* **Frame Rate (FPS):** frequency at which frames in a video sequence are
  displayed
  * Higher frame rate, better quality video = greater size
* **Interlaced (e.g. 1080i):**
  * Old Technology (70 years ago)
  * Each field of a video image displays every other horizontal line of a
    complete image $$\therefore$$ doubles FPS
  * Horizontal lines often visible to eye due to distortion
  * **Pros:** Refreshes faster, better visual smoothness and saves bandwidth
  * **Cons:** Becoming outdated and interlaced screen will not show fast
    moving objects clearly
* **Progressive (e.g. 720p):**
  * Excite every horizontal line simultaneously
  * Thus frame rate is the same as the number of individual pictures in a
    video sequence
  * This gives more detail in each frame
  * **Pros:** Crisp, detailed frames and is new and popular
  * **Con:** Rough frame transition
* **Inter-frame compression:**
  * Type of video compression and decreases file size
  * It removes neighboring frames which are similar
  * Some change in image data is redundant
  * How redundant the change in image between frames is determines the
    amount of compression possible
* **Temporal redundancy**: redundancy **between** frames
  * This is the correlation between adjacent data points
  * It is based upon abrupt transitions between frames
* **Spatial redundancy:** redundancy **within** a frame
  * An intercoded frame that is divided into macro blocks
  * Blocks are not directly encoded with raw pixel values
  * Encoder finds a block similar to the one in last frame
  * This frame is the reference frame
  * This process is done using algorithms
* **Multimedia Container Formats:**
  * Contains different types of data
  * Can be audio or video or both codecs
  * This interleaves the different type of data
  * The video is compressed into codecs
  * E.g. .avi, .mov, .mp4, .ogg, .rm
* **Lossy Data Compression:**
  * These programs eliminate unnecessary bits of data
  * Reduces data file size more than lossless
  * Unable to get back original version
* **Lossless Data Compression:**
  * Breaks data into smaller form of transmission
  * Allows recreation of original
